  <h2>JavaScript</h2>
  <h3>What is JavaScript?</h3>
  <p style="margin-top:-20px">
    JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.
    JavaScript was first known as LiveScript, but Netscape changed its name to JavaScript, possibly because of the excitement being generated by Java. JavaScript made its first appearance in Netscape 2.0 in 1995 with the name LiveScript. The general-purpose core of the language has been embedded in Netscape, Internet Explorer, and other web browsers.
  </p>

  <h3>Client-Side JavaScript</h3>
  <p style="margin-top:-20px">
    Client-side JavaScript is the most common form of the language. The script should be included in or referenced by an HTML document for the code to be interpreted by the browser.

    It means that a web page need not be a static HTML, but can include programs that interact with the user, control the browser, and dynamically create HTML content.

    The JavaScript client-side mechanism provides many advantages over traditional CGI server-side scripts. For example, you might use JavaScript to check if the user has entered a valid e-mail address in a form field.

    The JavaScript code is executed when the user submits the form, and only if all the entries are valid, they would be submitted to the Web Server.

    JavaScript can be used to trap user-initiated events such as button clicks, link navigation, and other actions that the user initiates explicitly or implicitly.
  </p>

  <h3>Where is JavaScript Today ?</h3>
  <p style="margin-top:-20px">
    The ECMAScript Edition 5 standard will be the first update to be released in over four years. JavaScript 2.0 conforms to Edition 5 of the ECMAScript standard, and the difference between the two is extremely minor.

    The specification for JavaScript 2.0 can be found on the following site: http://www.ecmascript.org/

    Today, Netscape's JavaScript and Microsoft's JScript conform to the ECMAScript standard, although both the languages still support the features that are not a part of the standard.
